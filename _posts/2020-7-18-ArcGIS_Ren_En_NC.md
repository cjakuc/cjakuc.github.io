It had been a little while since I last used ArcGIS during undergrad, so I wanted to refresh my skills by building a project.
I ended up creating visualizations on energy generation sources in the counties of North Carolina and using a bit of Python to help along the way.

Check out my map on ArcGIS Online directly [here](https://arcg.is/0HPWzD)!

Check out my Google Collaboratory notebook where I slightly cleaned and processed the energy data [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ej5pGq0ZnMaxz1DMD1fkHY09TGrXbo7K?usp=sharing)!

Check out my Medium post on the topic that details my process and findings [here](https://medium.com/@cjakuc/using-arcgis-online-to-explore-renewable-energy-generation-by-county-26886703ba2d)!
