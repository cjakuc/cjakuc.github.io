Check out my undergraduate capstone research project for replacing a coal power plant in North Carolina with Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) [here](/PDFs/CapstoneSMR_Final_Draft copy.pdf). You can check out the slide deck that my group used to present to an audience of peers and professionals [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ZZEYZjMA4KVTaRJOqRghgbseespamUg2PtlFYH-DRY/edit?usp=sharing).
