I've made a web application to help me track my job applications and do some automated analysis. The application is deployed [here](https://the-best-job-tracker.herokuapp.com/). You can see a video presentation of the first iteration of the project [here](https://youtu.be/-eOeFx0wUI0). The code for the project is on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/cjakuc/jobtracker).

I created a PostgreSQL database to store the data for the project and hosted it using ElephantSQL. You can see an entiry-relationship diagram ![here](/img/JobTracker-ER-Diagram.png).
