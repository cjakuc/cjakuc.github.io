Check out some of my data analysis skills in R through my project analyzing police killings in the United States [here](/PDFs/Final_Paper.html). The code for this project can be found on my Github page, [here](https://github.com/cjakuc/Data-Science-PK/blob/master/Final%20Paper) is a link to the R markdown file. You can view the slide deck that my group used to present our findings [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1euS3pktUZ89zFaaE1ADq8dsTnmtN707z8lcRgtVBpHs/edit?usp=sharing).
