title: About Me
---

My name is Chris Jakuc. I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and I am currently enrolled in Lambda School in the Data Science program. My undergraduate degree was in Envrionmental studies and I am particularly interested in sustainable energy generation. Within the field of data science I have experience cleaning data, web scraping, creating visualizations, and building predictive modeling. I am working to continue to build these skills as well as learn more about data engineering and machine learning. Outside of my career, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, cooking, traveling, lifting weights, and playing with my dog Pasha.
